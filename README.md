Hello there!, I made this repository as a request from some students at our school [ENSAT](http://ensat.ac.ma) in order to help them wisely choose an engineering branch that suits and fits their desires and skills, they are about to choose from 5 branches, which are :

+ **GSTR** : Telecomunication & Networking Engineering
+ **GIND** : Industrial & Logistics Engineering
+ **GINF** : Computer Science
+ **GSEA** : Electronic & Automatics Engineering
+ **G3EI** : Eco-Energy & Industrial Environment Engineering

> you can find a full description of these branches at our offical  ~~shitty~~ [website](http://ensat.ac.ma) :poop:

I need to mention that even if the language used to teach at our school is French, which I consider bad, English stays the main go to language to study and learn Computer Science, so friends, you need to get familiar with it! => first rule of Computer Science!

Clearly I'm gonna be talking only about **Computer Science**, and since there's a lot to cover, I'll be dividing this content into sections, each section will contain its own content, this way we can have better and more organised ressources.

Okay! let's start by the most important thing :  


## Motivation
>Every article, youtube or TED video, or whatever makes you fall in love with computer science


## Disciplines
+ Web Developement
+ Database Administration
+ System Administration


## Jobs
+ Software Engineer
+ Project Manager
+ Database Administrator
+ Security Engineer
+ CEO of your own company (why the hell not?) :sunglasses:


## Advantages
+ You can work from your own place wearing your underwear
+ All you need is on the internet & Google is your friend
+ You can go frealance parallelly with your full-time work


##Where to start (I'm a newbie)
We all have been there, it's hard at first, you don't know anything, but with a little of help you'll get throw it.

Let's do it Q/A style.

Q- From where should I start?

A- It depends on your motivation. If you want to go for the web, obviously you should start learning Html and CSS but after there is lot to learn, you will find it explained in this video:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB0WvcxTbCA">(Video)</a>.
If you found it overwhelming, don't panic, you don't need to know all these technologies to build a website.


Q- What if I let you  choose for me?

A- Well!!...., I would recommend for you JavaScript, BUT WAIT!! you have to learn it the right way.

I'm serious, JavaScript Is everywhere, you can build complete websites, APIs, mobile apps and furthermore, you can program embed systems just with JavaScript (node.js).
- tips: start with <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/"> Eloquent JavaScript </a>

Q- I heard of competitive programming; What the hell is this?

A- ICPC stands for international collegiate programming contest It's World Cup For programmers.
To go to it, at first, you have to get throw MCPC (M == Morocco) which is organised by ENCIAS then you have to get throw ACPC (A == Arab) which is organised by Egypt.
this types of competitions sharpen your programming skills, it involves lot off preparation, First find a team of 3 members and  start working right now.

Must read books:
+ introduction to algorithms
+ Programming Challenges

Follow this youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8OxKsmAyrGAfBiluhpLkbA">(Youtube)</a>

Create A topcoder account <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/">(Topcoder)</a> and start solving problems right know.
For more details, read this answer:<a href="http://www.quora.com/How-do-I-become-a-competitive-programmer
">(Quora)</a>

Q- What will I gain from such a competition?

Everything, it will distinguish you from other mediocre programmers, what is more it can get you to one the top companies in the US,  that will be the result of not just participation in such competitions but the hard work you do.
For inspiration take a look at these profiles.

Q - I wanna just validate my year, how do I do it?

A- It's easy to do these things and you'll the best year ever.
this summer learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and php and
study these books
