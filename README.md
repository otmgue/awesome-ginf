Hello there!, I made this repository as a request from some students at our school [ENSAT](http://ensat.ac.ma) in order to help them wisely choose an engineering branch that suits and fits their desires and skills, they are about to choose from 5 branches, which are : 

+ **GSTR** : Telecomunication & Networking Engineering
+ **GIND** : Industrial & Logistics Engineering
+ **GINF** : Computer Science
+ **GSEA** : Electronic & Automatics Engineering 
+ **G3EI** : Eco-Energy & Industrial Environment Engineering 

> you can find a full description of these branches at our offical  ~~shitty~~ [website](http://ensat.ac.ma) :poop:

I need to mention that even if the language used to teach at our school is French, which I consider bad, English stays the main go to language to study and learn Computer Science, so friends, you need to get familiar with it! => first rule of Computer Science!

Clearly I'm gonna be talking only about **Computer Science**, and since there's a lot to cover, I'll be dividing this content into sections, each section will contain its own content, this way we can have better and more organised ressources.

Okay! let's start by the most important thing :
